# Gee Major

Convert media files and turn 'em like it's from a 2000s YouTube Poop!

Usually, you'd need a program such as Sony Vegas or Audacity to achieve this,
but with this silly program written in Python and with most of the heavy lifting done
by FFmpeg, you can convert any video/audio to "G Major" in a matter of seconds!

## What is "G Major"?

"G Major" is fad stemming from the YouTube Poop genre, this effect is
usually achieved by duplicating audio channels and offsetting its
pitch, causing it to sound dissonant and "demonic"; accompanied by
applying an invert effect on the video.
